Example matchmaking with 12 ranks with the following assumptions:

The following matches have already occurred:
1v2
1v3
2v4
3v6
4v8

This is a different interpretation of the mm algorithm but essentially the same as the chart I made previously for SINoALICE GC matchmaking.

SINoALICE GC Predictor Link: https://www.sinotracker.app/gc-matchups

Process:
1. Start with a queue of all ranks
2. Take the first 2 ranks and check if they can match (e.g. 1 and 2. They can match if they have not previously matched)
3. If they can, that is one pairing. Remove both from queue and continue to next pair

4a. If cannot, then place both in a separate queue (Named "Side queue" in examples below).
4b. Then take the first of each queue and check if they can match. If they can, that is one pairing. Remove both from queues.  Else, add both to the second queue (Side queue)
4c. Repeat until "Side queue" empty. Then go back to step 2 and continue until empty.

-------------Matchmaking example process Starts here---------

1v2 not possible (Already matched)

Side queue: 1, 2,
Main queue: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12

1v3 - not possible (Already matched)

Side queue: 2, 1, 3
Main queue : 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12

2v4 - not possible (Already matched)

Side queue: 1, 3, 2, 4
Main queue : 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12

1v5 - possible (Have not matched yet)

Side queue: 3, 2, 4
Main queue: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12

3v6 - not possible

Side queue: 2, 4, 3, 6
Main queue: 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12

2v7 - possible (Have not matched)

Side queue: 4, 3, 6
Main queue: 8, 9, 10

4v8 - not possible (Already matched)

Side queue: 3, 6, 4, 8
Main queue: 9, 10, 11, 12

3v9 - possible (Have not matched)

Side queue: 6, 4, 8
Main queue: 10, 11, 12

6v10 - possible (Have not matched)

Side queue: 4, 8
Main queue: 11, 12

4v11 - possible (Have not matched)

Side queue: 8
Main queue: 12

8v12 - possible (Have not matched)
